# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Supervised Machine Learning



## Overview of the loan prediction analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine credit risk for LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, when a loas was processed. A number of determinants were looked at. Varoius approches were used to train and test data in order to arrive at an outcome. These approaches included: 

-  Naive Random Oversampling
-  SMOTE Oversampling
-  Undersampling
-  Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
-  Balanced Random Forest Classifier
-  Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Results

The various approached provided varing outcomes. I will go through them individually:

### Naive Random Oversampling



This sampling's accuracy score was 66.6%
The Recall score was 67% for both
